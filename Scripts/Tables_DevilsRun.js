    "Armadillo Tactic: A  solid defensive impenetrable parameter, which cannot be flanked, protected on all sides. Strength in numbers, attack as one. Approach in full defence, a synchronised tactical strike then retreat into defence. Conserving strength, and a continuous game of endurance",
    "Scorpion Tactic: A three-pronged attack, two pincers take turns to strike on each flank, drawing attention of target, one holds for the other to strike. The powerful tail moves in to strike from above from a distance (Artillery or Mortar) allowing the pincers to reload then repeat",
    "Coyote Tactic: A chaotic ambush! Always moving and mobile. Full force attacks to weaken a resource as they pass, then quickly escape. Burst tires, set fires, blind with oil or paint, damage weaponry and supplies, steal equipment",
    "Eagle Tactic: A maximum damage attack in a tight formation at full speed from nowhere. The eagle assesses the target and swoops in with concentrated range attacks. Then it switches to devastating melee to snatch away its target. Focused full force attacks on the same target until it is destroyed",
    "Rattle Snake Tactic: A tactically defensive formation; a wide, winding line, watching each other‚Äôs back. Feeding to the head, while the body can hide and move unseen. The snake‚Äôs wide formation and positioning gives perspective and awareness, using terrain to distract and disadvantage its target",
    "Wolf Tactic: A pack of aggressive hunters, wolves work together to exploit tired targets. The pack spreads out, keeping its distance. The wolf creates fear and deception, giving the impression of being a larger continuous threat. Waiting to take the weakest target",
    "Spider Tactic: An intelligent and patient predator. Using slow, methodical tactics and techniques. Setting traps and being prepared. The spider understands the strength of its target, only striking when the time is perfect. Using any means necessary to disable and disadvantage its target",
    "Vulture Tactic: Opportunistic and cunning. Steals from the dead. It uses stealth tactics to attack at the most vulnerable moment. Waits for the target to be already engaged and struggling. Scavenges from the weakest target. Hit and run when players are vulnerable",
    "Bear Tactic: A fearless and deadly attack fuelled by brute strength and aggression. Uses a highly intelligent, planned assault that exploits its targets‚Äô weaknesses. Divides and conquers. Takes no prisoners. Continuous aggression and might",
    "Chameleon Tactic: The deadliest. Mirrors and matches the tactics and style of its opponents. Versatile and fluid. Constantly evolving. Optimizes everything available to crush its target"
