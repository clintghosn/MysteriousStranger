// descriptions
var YZ_descriptions = {
    events_ark: {
        DangerAhead: "A new threat appears, but not exactly where the PCs are. They see or hear something in the distance, or they learn something worrying. You can use this event to introduce a new Threat Card against the Ark, or create a conflict with an existing NPC.",
        FightOverProject: "During the Assembly, the players decide which projects the People will undertake. Having NPCs try to sabotage or control the projects is usually an effective way to engage players.",
        ThreatEscalates: "Each of the 25 Threat Cards describes an internal or external threat to the Ark. These threats usually cannot be ignored by anyone in the Ark, nor by the PCs.",
        FightOverGear: "In Mutant: Year Zero, the PCs' grub, bullets, weapons and other gear can make the difference between life and death. Want to instantly increase the intensity of a gaming session? Have an NPC try to steal a PC's gear.",
        AppealingOffer: "The PCs' personal goals are central in this game, but a juicy offer from some NPC can also create drama.",
        PCGetsIntoTrouble: "Pick one PC, and shower him with misery. Maybe he gets scammed trying to strike a deal, robbed in a dark corner of the Ark or threatened by a powerful Boss.",
        NPCGetsIntoTrouble: "Pick one NPC, and shower him with misery. Maybe he gets scammed trying to strike a deal, robbed in a dark corner of the Ark or threatened by a powerful Boss.",
        PCvsPC: "The PCs are not always best friends. Sometimes they have different opinions on how to run the Ark, or they simply hate each other. Use this event to create conflict between the PCs.",
        UnwantedConsequences: "The PCs' actions have consequences. Sometimes they are not what the PCs expected. Sometimes they are not what the PCs wanted.",
        GlimpseOfTheDream: "The Ark is a harsh place, but the PCs have dreams. They dream of a better life, of a life in the Zone without the constant threat of death. Use this event to give the PCs a glimpse of their dream."
    },
    events_zone: {
        ABeaconInTheDistance: "The Zone is full of threats and dangers, but also of opportunities. Give the PCs something to strive for, to journey toward. It can be a mysterious light in the distance, a building that seems strangely intact, a gate to an ancient shelter, a group of strange people in the distance, or something else.",
        DangerAhead: "Just like in the Ark, you can create dramatic tension in the Zone by describing a looming threat, something unnerving at the horizon. It's most effective if you have just used the Beacon in the Distance event above, enticing the PCs to keep going forward. The new threat creates an interesting dilemma.",
        AHardChoice: "Present a difficult dilemma to the players. It can be the result of the two events listed above, Beacon in the Distance and Danger Ahead - when they have some enticing goal ahead of them, place a dangerous threat or obstacle in their way. Will they press on or turn back?",
        GearIsLost: "Out in the Zone, the PCs' gear - weapons, grub, bullets and artifacts - can be the difference between life and death. If you really want to make your players sweat - take their stuff. But always give them a chance of getting it back some way.",
        SleeplessNight: "To keep their Wits intact, the PCs need at least four hours of unbroken sleep per night. It doesn't sound like much, but if you disturb their sleep several nights in a row, it can drive them to the brink of desperation. In the Zone, there is much to keep the PCs awake at night.",
        PCGetsIntoTrouble: "Pick one PC, and shower him with misery. Maybe he gets scammed trying to strike a deal, robbed in a dark corner of the Ark or threatened by a powerful Boss.",
        NPCGetsIntoTrouble: "Pick one NPC, and shower him with misery. Maybe he gets scammed trying to strike a deal, robbed in a dark corner of the Ark or threatened by a powerful Boss.",
        PCvsPC: "The PCs are not always best friends. Sometimes they have different opinions on how to run the Ark, or they simply hate each other. Use this event to create conflict between the PCs.",
        TheZoneVsEveryone: "The Zone is a dangerous place, and sometimes it's not just the PCs who are in danger. Sometimes the whole group is threatened by something in the Zone.",
        AnUnexpectedEncounter: "In the wasteland that is the Zone, there are many enemies and threats. But if the PCs are lucky, they might also run into people who are friendly - or at least ready to negotiate. Let encounters with other factions be tense meetings. Keep the players guessing. Let the PCs meet a group of friendly mutants - who turn out to be blood-thirsty cannibals. Or let the PCs meet some wild Zone-Ghouls - who seek to bargain, not to kill."
    },
    threat: {
            BossVsBoss: "A Boss sees an opportunity to become top dog. During one bloody night, she tries to wipe out all of her competition and become the sole ruler of the Ark. But one of her rivals survives, and launches a counter-offensive. No one in the Ark is unaffected - if you don't pick a side, no one will protect you against the raging violence.",
            AChildOfThePeople: "The Slave Sira has complained of stomach pains for some time, but who cares about a Slave? Now everyone cares. They say that Sira will give birth to a child. The news spreads like wildfire in the Ark. If it's true, it's the first time that anyone can remember that a child is born to the People.",
            TheDerelictOilRig: "Through the thick fog of the Zone it comes floating slowly - a gigantic rusting metal hulk. The four-legged oil platform, as tall as the ruins at the heart of the Zone, beaches and casts its ominous shadow over the Ark. What secrets could be hidden inside it?",
            TheHelldrivers: "It sounds like a thunderstorm in the distance. But coming closer, the noise turns into the loud revving of powerful engines, and every mutant in the Ark runs to see what is coming. Dozens of cars and motorcycles with grim drivers and riders roll up to the gates. Stalkers have told stories about the fearsome Helldrivers, few thought they were real. Now, they are here.",
            TheHunger: "Grub has been scarce in the Ark for some time, but now the situation is truly desperate. The stockpile of canned food is gone, and every mutant has to find their own means to feed themselves. Starvation sets in and the fight for grub will be brutal.",
            TheKillingMachine: "A small Zone expedition returns, bloody and exhausted. Several members of the group have been killed, and the survivors are delirious. They claim to have been attacked by a walking machine. Has the Rot driven them all insane?",
            TheLastDrop: "The water source in the Ark fails. The well goes dry, the water purifier breaks down or the cistern bursts - whatever the reason, it's a disaster. Whatever Rot-free water is left in cans and bottles will only last a few days",
            LostTreasure: "An expensive and important item in the Ark has disappeared without a trace. It can be something the People have built: a tool, a spare part, or an artifact from the Old Age. The item has been stolen in the dead of night. Now, everyone suspects everyone else.",
            TheManOnTheBeach: "No one knows where the man without memory came from. One cold morning he lies shivering with hypothermia on a beach near the Ark, where some scavengers find him. He speaks in a strange, foreign accent, but manages to explain that he can't remember who he is. Apart from a worn coverall with strange markings, there are no clues to his origin. He seems to lack all mutations.",
            MissingPerson: "An NPC disappears from the Ark without a trace. It might be someone close to a PC, a revered Chronicler or some other important person. Soon, the Ark is awash with rumors about what has happened. Has the missing person been killed? Have the Zone-Ghouls taken him away? Or - has he found Eden?",
            MurderInTheArk: "A generally well-liked person in the Ark, or someone close to a PC, is found brutally murdered one morning. The body has been hacked to pieces. Nothing like this has ever happened in the Ark before.",
            MutantMessiah: "A minor Boss dreams strange dreams and begins to proclaim his visions of death and destruction to the People. Fatalistic hopelessness and the futility of all things are the core elements of this message, which attracts a growing number of followers.",
            TheMysteriousRuin: "A Stalker has seen a strange building in the Zone. Could there be grub or bullets there? A Boss wants to send out an expedition, and is looking for volunteers.",
            ANewKindOfBeast: "Wandering in the Zone is always dangerous, but these last few days, even the most fearless Stalkers hardly dare leave the Ark. They say a new kind of beast is hunting out there. Not slow-witted monsters, but creatures with the intelligence of mutants and the ferocity of wild beasts.",
            TheOtherPeople: "They come walking out of the smog without warning. A group of mutants just like the People - but not as skinny and miserable. They say they come from a settlement out in the Zone, another Ark - and they want an alliance. They ask some of the People to come with them to their Ark, as guests.",
            ProjectSabotaged: "Under the cover of darkness, someone has sabotaged an important project in the Ark. All of the hard work is lost, and needs to be redone from scratch. Everyone whispers about who did it and why, and the People start to regard each other with suspicion.",
            Revolution: "Discontent is brewing among the People. The mutants hunger, while the Bosses have their fill. All it takes is a spark - an Enforcer strikes his Boss - and soon the entire Ark is set aflame as Slaves rise against their owners and take revenge for years of abuse.",
            TheSinkhole: "In the dead of night, the Ark is shaken by a terrible rumble and tremor. When the dust settles, the People realize that nothing but a deep hole is left where some make-shift huts used to stand. The walls of the hole are steep and it is so deep you cannot see the bottom of it.",
            Starfall: "Suddenly, night turns into day. A light in the sky, stronger than any star, shoots across the night sky from east to west. The fireball disappears for an instant, darkness briefly falling over the Zone again. Then the horizon suddenly lights up in a massive but silent explosion.",
            TheWanderers: "They come wandering through the Zone, a scrawny and grim-faced bunch in tattered old clothes. They speak in a strange and foreign accent, but manage to explain that they have wandered for several years from the mountains far away. They ask the People for grub and protection. None of the wanderers seem to have any mutations at all.",
            TheZoneCult: "There are rumors about a cult said to live in an ancient ruin in the Zone. They say they have found the truth about the Apocalypse, and that they know how to avoid another one. The cult leader is a charismatic mutant who has convinced a small group of followers that the Ark is doomed.",
            TheZoneFever: "This deadly, bloody disease strikes suddenly and without mercy. From one day to the next mutants go from healthy to dying in a horrible fever, bleeding from all bodily cavities. The fever spreads like wildfire in the Ark. If nothing is done - quickly - the People will perish. But where is the cure?",
            ZoneGhoulsAttack: "They attack before dawn, without warning or mercy. They come from the deeps of the Zone, and enter the Ark while the People are sleeping. Then, the massacre begins. The Zone-Ghouls kill, burn and plunder with a feverish frenzy. Can the People stop them - or is this the end?",
            TheZoneMonster: "The People have had enough. There is a wild beast about that has torn mutants to pieces out in the Zone, and even started attacking people collecting scrap right outside the Ark's walls. A Boss wants to lead a hunting expedition into the Zone to deal this threat once and for all.",
            TheZoneShakes: "It starts as a deep rumble from the very ground itself. Then the earth shakes, soon violently. Anyone not holding on to something is thrown to the ground. Then, as suddenly as it started, it's over. For now."
    },
    ruins_normal: {
        AirplaneWreck: "A huge metal tube lies broken and crushed on the ground. It is scorched by fire and inside there are rows of ancient seats, all blackened by flames. Stretching away from the tube, the ground is scorched and all houses destroyed, as if the tube had come crashing from the sky at incredible speed.",
        AmusementPark: "A bizarre huddle of rusting machines and decrepit large tents, in colors that once were stark. The remains of the tent cloth flaps in the wind. On a picture, a man with a white face and a large red nose smiles at you. One machine is a large wooden disc with plastic horses mounted on it. The disc is placed on a motor and seems to have been able to rotate.",
        Battlefield: "This area is completely devastated. Rusty rebars protrude from broken blocks of concrete that once were the walls of homes. The ruins are scorched by explosions and riddled with bullet holes. Small craters pockmark the ground.",
        BusStation: "Among flaking road signs with illegible numbers and letters, several big old motor vehicles stand rusting away. Some have two decks, others have an accordion-like contraption in the middle and can bend. The Ancients' machines are truly mysterious.",
        CarPark: "The concrete pillars have given in and the entire, circular building has collapsed like an accordion pressed together. In the debris, lots of motor vehicles from the Old Age are buried. Maybe some of them could be repaired?",
        Church: "The ancient spire on the stone building reaches far into the sky, its sharp point lost in the Zone haze. Inside, there are rows of rotten wooden benches, all turned toward the figure of a man hanging on a cross. The Ancients used to come here to talk to their Boss in the sky. Now, all is quiet. If there is a god, it has abandoned this place long ago.",
        Cinema: "Next to a large entrance leading into the dark interior of this building, a number of yellowing posters hang in huge frames. Each of the posters depict dramatic motifs from the Old Age. In this cavernous building, the Ancients watched moving images on a screen.",
        Crater: "A gigantic hole appears in the ground, at least 50 yards across. Some ancient weapon of annihilation must have struck here, destroying everything nearby. In the bottom of the crater, there is a small lake of greenish rotwater.",
        DilapidatedMansion: "This dark and decrepit house was old even before the Fall. It's built of wood and stone and has somehow managed to withstand the decades of neglect. What could be hidden inside its dark halls?",
        FastFoodJoint: "A large M in the shape of two dirty yellow arcs adorn the facade of this ruined building. There are many facilities like this in the Zone. What used to be in them no one knows any longer, but Stalkers tend to avoid them because of the strong Rot inside.",
        GasStation: "Underneath an open roof next to a low house, a number of car wrecks are left to rust. Next to them there are machines with hoses and faucets. Anyone who knows his way around the Zone knows that this is a place where the Ancients repaired their vehicles and filled them up with fuel.",
        Highway: "The concrete is cracked and the markings on the road surface are all but worn away. Before the Fall, the Ancients would whizz by here at incredible speeds in their shiny motor carriages. Now, the old cars stand by the roadside, burnt out and rusted beyond repair.",
        Hospital: "When the Apocalypse came, the Ancients flooded this concrete hulk of a building, desperately hoping to be saved. Now, this is a crumbling ruin. Decayed corpses lie everywhere in rooms and hallways, on beds and on the floors.",
        HuntingStore: "Among the decrepit shelves in this place you can find fishing poles, hooks and lines. A skilled Stalker can use these items to find edible fish in the Zone waters (page 56). On the walls, yellowed pictures of rifles hang. In one corner, there is a heavy metal locker tall as a mutant - perhaps there is something valuable in there?",
        Mall: "A city within a city reveals itself, huge halls with ancient shops and restaurants in several levels. Everything in here is scorched by fire long ago and covered in soot, but perhaps something valuable is hidden among the ashes? Here and there strange plastic figures stand in strange poses, as if preaching to the crowd.",
        Marina: "Just off the shore, a great number of boat wrecks lie half sunken in the rotwater. Sailing boats, motor boats and canoes that the Ancients used for recreation have turned into a dangerous reef of cracked plastic and metal beams.",
        Museum: "Large steps in broken stone lead up to this grand building. Inside, there are dark halls with strange items from the Old Age and even ages before that, all showcased for the Ancients to see.",
        OfficeBuilding: "In this dark ruin you can find large halls, all filled with identical tables in small booths. On the floor, there are yellowed papers everywhere. Before the Fall, important work was probably done here.",
        OvergrownPark: "Tall trees and thick bushes grow wild here and have completely overgrown the area. Benches, walking paths and fountains are hidden by thick weeds and the lawns are turned into marshlands. There are many rumors about the creatures that roam the old parks in the Zone.",
        Playground: "Car tires hang in rusty chains from a metal frame. A wooden sandbox has turned into a stinking pool of mud. Acid rains have gnawed holes in the metal slides long ago. Here, the Ancients played with their children. A few cracked plastic toys have survived the decades of wear and still lie abandoned in the sand.",
        PoliceStation: "Outside of this large building, wrecks of identical blue and white cars are rusting away. The tires and long since gone, but the blue plastic lamps on their roofs are still there. In the basement of the building, there are rooms that cannot be opened from the inside.",
        RadioStation: "A forest of rusty antennae and metal discs protrude from the roof of this massive building. A sign on the facade shows an antenna with rings around it.",
        ResidentialBlocks: "Several identical tall buildings, made of concrete that is now cracked and crumbling. On the ground between these monoliths, there are rotted benches and tall weeds. Car wrecks are everywhere, most rusted beyond repair. Each of the buildings has a large number of identical apartments. Inside, you can find decrepit furniture, clothes and other items.",
        RoadTunnel: "The entrance to this broad tunnel looks like the maw of an enormous beast. Outside, an innumerable amount of cars, trucks and buses stand tightly packed together, slowly rusting into nothing. Whatever horror the occupants of these vehicles were fleeing from, it is obvious few survived.",
        RuinedBridge: "The remains of a majestic bridge rise tall in the Zone haze. It has collapsed in both directions and only two thick pillars remain, but if you can climb up onto the remaining roadway you'll have a great lookout position.",
        School: "On the crumbling brick facade of this building hangs a clock that stopped long ago. Below it someone has written text on the wall, no longer legible. On the concrete ground in front of the building there are two rusty metal rods, each a little taller than a mutant and with a metal ring at the top.",
        Shelter: "A massive rusty metal door in the rockside leads deep underground. Down there, the Ancients sought refuge from the horrors on the surface. Now, it's a perfect place to look for artifacts. But who knows what's lurking down here, who else might have found this dungeon full of treasure?",
        Skyscraper: "A tall building rises toward the yellow haze of the Zone sky. The concrete is withered and broken, and all of the hundreds of windows have fallen from their frames long ago. Now, the Zone wind blows right through the many floors of this majestic building. Every floor is filled by small and identical apartments or offices. Only the top floor looks different, with bigger and more luxurious accommodations - if you can get all the way up there…",
        SportsCenter: "A large, spacious hall made of rusty corrugated steel. Inside, there are strange objects like thick mattresses covered in red plastic, large nets on frames, clubs with holes in them and balls in all colors and sizes. They say the Ancients went to places like this to exercise.",
        Suburbia: "A street with identical small houses in even rows on each side. The grass and bushes have withered away long ago, everything is covered in ashes. Inside the houses, decomposing clothes and other personal items remain. The inhabitants must have left in a hurry. Car wrecks, and other remains from the Ancients who used to live here, abound. Much has decayed over time and some of the houses are completely collapsed.",
        SubwayStation: "By a stairway leading down into the underground a large sign with flaking paint hangs. All Stalkers know what this sign means. This is an entrance to the tunnels under the Zone. In the deeps, terrible dangers await - but perhaps also many untouched artifacts.",
        Supermarket: "A grand building rises among the ruins. Its large windows were broken many decades ago, and the Zone dust drifts in unhindered. Before the Fall, this building housed an unimaginable amount of food, drink, kitchen utensils and other things that the Ancients consumed at a dizzying rate. Now, most of it is looted, burnt or decayed.",
        SwimmingHall: "Inside this large ruin, there are big pools filled with mud and slimy algae. Noxious and toxic fumes meet anyone who enters. It's hard to imagine that the Ancients went here voluntarily to bathe in the pools.",
        Tank: "A massive and awe-inspiring metal vehicle blocks the path. Its enormous tracks have rusted stuck long ago and no death or destruction has spewed out from its cannon for many decades, but coming close to this metal beast still strikes fear into the heart of almost any Zone wanderer.",
        Theater: "Inside of this dark ruin is a great hall, filled with rows of seats facing a large stage with a grand red curtain. The Ancients came here to see singing, dancing and stage plays.",
        TrainStation: "Ancient railway cars stand rusting on overgrown tracks. In these, the Ancients used to travel quickly and effectively all across the Zone and beyond. Now, the only passengers are decaying corpses."

    ruins_industry: {
        Factory: "The metal roof of this large, flat building has caved in long ago. Inside, there are machines and strange vehicles with huge forks in the front. Everything in here is ravaged by decades of rain and wind. Some rusty old barrels have fallen over and a greenish sludge has leaked out onto the floor.",
        FiringRange: "Empty shell casings litter this large open area. In one end, there is a large earthwork with lots of pockmarks from bullets. In a shed close by there are targets in the shape of humans and animals. In the Old Age, they could afford to spend bullets on shooting at paper figures.",
        MilitaryBase: "A large square courtyard with brick buildings on each side. In the buildings, there are a great number of identical rooms with metal bunk beds. Beyond these buildings there is a large garage with several burnt out vehicles inside.",
        OilTank: "This large cylinder-shaped metal building has a narrow stairway winding its way around the outside wall, all the way to the top. Up there, you could spot any threats from a safe distance. The building contains a huge tank filled by a sticky, black liquid. A Gearhead could use this as fuel. The problem is just getting it out…",
        Pipeline: "A thick rusty metal pipe runs through this part of the Zone. It's wide enough for a mutant to crawl through. The gas and oil has stopped flowing through these pipes long ago. Now, they can only serve as scrap.",
        PowerLine: "A tall tower made of rusty metal beams rises into the Zone sky. It has collapsed halfway up, and the sharp spire has folded down toward the ground. Thick cables, that once supplied electricity to the entire Zone, now lie draped across the ground.",
        PurificationPlant: "The stench intensifies for each and every step closer to this building. But Stalkers know that the smell of decay can hide an invaluable treasure. These large pools, tanks and machines purified the Ancients' drinking water. Could there still be clean water in any of the tanks?",
        RadioMast: "A tall metal mast rises high above the zonescape. It is held up by thick metal wires, and at the top big rusty antennae sprout. Once, wireless transmissions were sent from here to the people of the Old Age, for their amusement and education. Now, there is nothing to hear but the Zone wind.",
        Refinery: "An entire landscape full of rusting and decaying machinery covers this part of the Zone. Enormous tanks are connected by metal tubes, some wide enough for a mutant to crawl through. If you dare, you can climb through these metallic deadlands on ladders, girders and walkways.",
        RubbishDump: "A mountain of trash blocks your path. Here, the Ancients dumped everything they didn't need. Most has been ground to dust by the passage of time, but plastic items and large chunks of rusty metal protrude from the heap.",
        Shipwreck: "A big rusty ship lies wrecked just off the shore, half sunken beneath the waves. The empty portholes make the ship look like a huge beached whale. Could there still be useful scrap in the engine room?",
        Windmill: "A thin, white tower rises tall over the zonelands. At the top, a huge propeller is mounted. They say the Ancients started to build windmills like this one to get energy when the oil in the ground started to run out. It was much too late, of course."
    },
    threat_humanoid: {
        Amnesiac: "Rarity: -2. A human woman staggers through the Zone. Her eyes are glazed over and seem to focus on some imagined horror. She mumbles alien words, barely audible. She wears dirty and torn coveralls with strange markings. She doesn't respond to the PCs and collapses on the ground if they try to stop her. Unless Healed, she dies in a couple of hours. If she survives the PCs can talk to her, but her dialect is foreign and she seems to have lost all memory of who she is and where she came from. She might have a clue to the location of Eden. If you have played the Threat Card called The Man on the Beach, the PCs can recognize both the clothing and the dialect - the woman has the same. She also reacts in a similar way if brought to the Ark. Just like the man on the beach, the woman is one of the cryo-frozen lab assistants from Project Eden",
        BeastMutants: "Rarity: -1. Out in the Zone, there is a tribe of beings that are different from all others. They are not human mutants and they are not wild beasts - they are both. They are animals, but they walk upright on their hind legs, use tools and have a spoken language - primitive and coarse, but a language nonetheless. They are newcomers to the Zone, on their guard or even hostile to strangers. Despite their few numbers the beast mutants seem to belong to several different species - some look like ragged dogs or wolves, others are short and rodent-like, and a third variety are monkey-like climbers. The truth is that the beast mutants - like the People themselves - can trace their origin to the genetics labs of the Ancients, bred to be able to survive the harsh world after the Apocalypse. They are animals given parts of the human intellect and fine motor skills. The small tribe that recently arrived in the Zone has fled from an old research facility located in a distant mountain range, where many of their kin still are being held captive by the mysterious Watchers. The escapees have journeyed to the area of the Zone to find a new home.",
        Cannibals: "Rarity: ±0. A group of wiry mutants wearing rags and white face paint. These mutants come from an Ark where the scientists died early on, and the abandoned children developed a very brutal society. They are sly and bloodthirsty, and they hunger for fresh mutant meat. They can't easily be reasoned with (modification -3 to any Manipulation attempt, and even a successful roll will only buy the PCs time until the cannibals get hungry again). Only a very clear show of force will deter the cannibals. Any fallen mutants in their own ranks will soon become grub for the survivors.",
        DoomCultists: "Rarity: +1. A small band of mutants, expelled from their Ark years ago, who worship a particular ruin or artifact in the Zone. They have all lost common sense and live only to worship the object, which they think will bring the Ancients back to Earth. The cultists may try to recruit PCs and NPCs, or capture them to sacrifice them to their deity. The cult may be in possession of a clue to Eden.",
        ExiledMutants: "Rarity: ±0. A dozen mutants in a sorry state. Their clothes are in tatters, some are limping, others have untreated and infected wounds. They are all starving and badly contaminated by the Rot. Some might even be infected by Parasite Fungus or the Gutfish. These mutants come from another Ark, but have been exiled for some reason. They beg the PCs for help, but they also take the first chance they get to attack and steal the PCs grub - or worse. If the PCs are friendly, the exiles can tell them about their Ark - and they might even have a clue about the location of Eden.",
        ExpeditionFromAnotherArk: "Rarity: +1. An expedition, not unlike the PCs' own, but from another Ark. The strangers are about as many as the PCs. If they haven't met mutants from another Ark before (through the Threat Card called The Other People), this meeting can be a turning point in the history of both peoples. The expedition may have an artifact with a clue leading to the location of Eden.",
        Helldivers: "Rarity: ±0. Thunder as from an approaching storm rolls across the zonelands. Soon, a horde of bizarre vehicles comes rolling. Cars, buses, motorcycles and trucks - all adorned with sharp spikes, skulls and scrap. The feared Helldrivers are mutants who left their Ark long ago and were lucky enough to come across a big garage with operational vehicles from the Old Age.",
        Morlocks: "Rarity: ±0. Some degenerate wild mutants from lost Arks have taken refuge underground, in tunnels and shelters. These are called morlocks. During the years, the morlocks have lost what little civilization they started with. Now, they are little more than savages and communicate with grunts and snarls. They are not hostile to strangers, but on their guard. If given something in return, they can provide help or information. If attacked, they defend themselves with animal ferocity. They may be in possession of an artifact that gives a clue to the location of Eden.",
        NovaCultists: "Rarity: -1. A procession of men and women with shaved heads, dressed in long robes. They leave some cloth bundles on the ground and leave quietly. If the PCs investigate, they find that each bundle contains a small mutant baby. They are hypothermic and weak, and will die unless the PCs Heal them. Any surviving children will develop powerful mental mutations. The robed people belong to the mythical Nova Cult. If the PCs confront the cultists, they treat them like air or are spoken to like children. If the PCs resort to violence, the cultists won't hesitate to defend themselves.",
        PatrolFromTheArk: "Rarity: ±0. This patrol from the PCs' own Ark has found a valuable artifact, or they say they know where to find one. The leader either wants help to bring the artifact back to the Ark, or help to retrieve it. One of the members of the patrol can very well be an NPC that a PC has a relationship to.",
        ScrapOracle: "Rarity: -1. A short and stocky mutant, dressed in a bizarre outfit made of scrap of all shapes and sizes. He's an oddball character with powerful mental mutations, a telepath that can see visions of the PCs' possible future. His powers can help the PCs interpret a clue to Eden or guide them in some other way. You can use the scrap oracle to nudge the PCs in some direction that you'd like the campaign to go.",
        Wanderers: "Rarity: -1. A scrawny and grim-faced band of humans in tattered clothes with a strange look come walking through the zonelands. They are on their guard but not hostile. If the PCs show that they mean no harm, the wanderers can tell - in a strange and foreign dialect - that they have walked for years from a mountain range far away. They ask for grub and water. They want to know where the PCs' settlement is, and may get hostile if they refuse to answer.",
        WaterTrader: "Rarity: ±0. A lonesome traveler who defies the dangers of the zonelands to trade with clean water. He's a tall mutant pulling a simple cart, followed by two scrawny mutts. On the cart there are old plastic bottles, big jerrycans and a strange contraption built of pipes and bottles (a Jury-Rigged purification set). The water trader is friendly sort and always ready to do business - and quite ready to defend himself if he needs to. He knows much about the Zone and can tell the PCs where other settlements are located. He may also have a clue to Eden, which he could trade for. He will ask where the PCs live and will try to get to the Ark to do business.",
        Wreckers: "Rarity: ±0. A surprisingly intact big old vehicle wreck sits in a clearing in the Zone. Its windows are dirty and its hatches locked. The wreck is a trap. A band of savage mutants or Zone-Ghouls uses it as bait for unwitting Zone travelers. Their typical plan is simple: They charge out and try attack their victims before they see what's coming. They will steal everything and take any survivors as slaves in their tribe. The wreckers haven't been able to open the armored car themselves. If the PCs manage to get in, they will find an artifact. The car engine is decayed beyond repair.",
        ZoneGhouls: "Rarity ±0. When Stalkers tell harrowing stories by the trash-can fires in the Ark, they are most often about the Zone-Ghouls. These aggressive people live like nomads in the Zone, moving in the shadows and attacking other travelers without warning. They are most active at night. There are many rumors about the Zone-Ghouls - it is said that they flay and eat mutants taken captive. Zone-Ghouls are generally shorter than mutants, and they move in large groups. They hide their faces in hoods or masks made of scrap from the Old Age, and often wear scavenged plastic cloaks to protect them against sunlight and acid rains. Their hands and feet are wrapped in plastic or cloth."
    },
    threat_monster: {
        AcidGrass: "Rarity: -1. A field of tall grass. A sharp smell hangs in the air, and in the undergrowth remains of dead animals can be seen. The grass moves back and forth as if in a wind - despite the air being dead calm here. The grassy field is actually a predatory plant. If any animal or mutant walk in to the grass, it will start to entangle itself into the victim's feet, legs and gear. Then, the grass starts to excrete a potent acid, slowly melting the target into a stinking sludge that the grass can feed on. Effect: A PC who actively and successfully Scouts the area will notice the old bones in the grass. Anyone moving into the field is immediately attacked by six Base Dice. On a hit, the victim is snared and suffers one point of damage from the acid. To get free, the victim needs to make a Force roll (others can help, page 48). Until then, he suffers another point of damage every turn. The grass can only be damaged by fire. Count its total Strength as 10. When it reaches zero, the grass is dead and the area can be passed without risk.",
        AirJellies: "Rarity: ±0. Air Jellies are strange creatures, translucent fleshy bubbles the size of an open palm. Thin, long feelers hang down from the main body. They are lighter than air and hover, blowing wherever the wind takes them. Anything that the feelers come into contact with is covered by a sticky, acidic liquid - not harmful to human skin, but corrosive to metal. Effect: Air Jellies don't attack mutants themselves, but rather their gear. Roll to attack against using six Base Dice (the Strength score of the swarm). Every / decreases the Gear Bonus of the target item by one step. The attacks continue until the Air Jellies are destroyed or the victims manage to escape. Swarm: Air Jellies can only be hurt by fire or explosions. Swarm: Air Jellies can only be hurt by fire or explosions.",
        Automaton: "Rarity: -2. In the dark depths of the enclaves (Chapter 16), the Titan Powers built machines of metal, plastic and circuits, so advanced that they could compete with their own creators in intelligence, adaptability and creativity. Some researchers even experimented in melting together man and machine, in the hope of creating a being more adapted to surviving in the postapocalyptic world. Robots and biomechatronic beings, in many shapes and sizes, will be explored in a future expansion to Mutant: Year Zero. But already in the base game, PCs can run into a rare automaton that for some reason has found its way to the Zone. For the People, such a being will be seen as a horrible abomination, a walking or hovering metal being with weapons mounted in its very body. Special: The automaton cannot suffer fatigue at all.",
        Bitterbeast: "Rarity: -1. Dangerous creatures that Stalkers call Bitterbeasts often prowl the Zone close to lakes and swamps. These are giant lizards, twice the size of a normal mutant. Bitterbeasts are fairly intelligent and it is even said they can be tamed and used as mounts. That's not without risk however. The Bitterbeasts are known for their foul temper and the ability that has given them their name - they spit acid with alarming accuracy.",
        Deathworm: "Rarity: ±0. A mutated abomination that hunts by burrowing through the ground and waiting for an unwitting victim to pass by. The Deathworm is twice the length of a mutant and thick as a leg. It's covered in scales, has innumerable small legs and a big gaping maw with several rings of small but very sharp teeth. The beast is very tenacious and will keep attacking until its victim or it is dead. It lacks the intelligence to flee.",
        Devourer: "Rarity: ±0. A large and savage predator, taller than a mutant when it stands on its hind legs. It has grey fur and looks a little like a bear, but the similarities end there. The Devourer has an insatiable hunger for flesh, can move with extreme silence, and has abnormally huge jaws. It sneaks up on its prey, who often doesn't realize what's going on before it's halfway down the gullet of the beast. The jaws can be dislocated to fit the whole upper body of a grown mutant. Corrosive saliva quickly kills the prey, who won't be released until it's dead or the Devourer is forced to flee.",
        Grazers: "Rarity: +1. Here and there in the Zone, herds of relatively peaceful grazing animals roam. These are mutated versions of sheep, goats, pigs and cows. They have gone feral and won't hesitate to attack Zone travelers that they see as threat to the herd. Grazers are good targets for hunting (see the Butcher talent in Chapter 4).",
        Gutfish: "Rarity: ±0. The Gutfish is a feared parasite that spreads through drinking water. Even Rot-free water can be infected - the only way to be safe is to boil the water. The Gutfish spawn grow inside the stomach of the host, feeding off whatever the host eats. When the Gutfish, which looks more like an eel than a fish, is fully grown (approximately six feet long) it bites its way out and slithers away to the nearest lake or creek. Effect: After the infection, the host gets incredibly hungry and must eat at least two rations of grub per day not to become starving (page 92). After 2D6 days, the Gutfish is fully grown and tries to gnaw its way out. This will automatically break the host (Strength drops to zero) and suffers the Bleeding Gut critical injury.",
        KillerTree: "Rarity: -1. An overgrown area that is unnervingly still and quiet. This is the home of one of the most feared and bizarre beings in the entire Zone - the Killer Tree. Its thick, dark trunk ends in a gaping maw, that is surrounded by slithering tentacles. Among the tree's thick and gnarled roots lie bones, skulls and rusty gear - remains of the Killer Tree's many victims. The most astonishing parts of this semi-sentient plant are its humanoid seed pods. They can mimic human (or mutant) appearance and even speech, but lack actual intelligence. The seed pods prowl the area, hunting for victims to feed their ever hungry mother tree. Mind Control: The Killer Tree can lure its victims close with powerful telepathic pulses. Anyone within Short range must roll to Move - a failed roll means the victim suffers one point of confusion and must move closer to the tree. Seed Pods: Victims who manage to withstand the tree's mind powers are usually attacked by its humanoid seed pods. In their natural state, the pods have greenish hue and lack both body hair and any distinct facial features. A seed pod can mimic the exact appearance of a human or mutant, by pushing tendrils into the brain of the victim and extracting its stem cells. The victim, who needs to be held down or broken by damage for the attack to be made, dies in the process. A seed pod becomes totally identical to its victim and can even mimic its voice, but is completely without emotion and cannot be Manipulated or Intimidated.",
        MindMosquitoes: "Rarity -1. In the Zone, there are areas buzzing with mosquitoes that can have direct impact on the human (or mutant) mind. Anyone moving in the area starts to feel depressed and despondent. The victims feel a growing urge to just sit down and do nothing at all, which lets the mosquitoes suck blood unhindered. The attack in itself is not harmful, but the mental effects can have dangerous consequences. Effect: Victims affected by the Mind Mosquitoes each turn suffer an attack with a number of Base Dice equal to the Strength of the swarm - a typical starting value is 8. Each / rolled inflicts one point of doubt. To get away, a victim needs to make a Move roll. The swarm can only be hurt by fire or explosions. When its Strength reaches zero, it is completely destroyed.",
        NightmareFlowers: "Rarity: -1. An area filled with large flowers, clinging to every surface. Heavy and moist petals, stamens and pistils grow with intense colors. If anyone moves through the area, the flowers will exude a cloud of spores with a strong sedative effect. When a victim falls unconscious to the ground, the plants' thorny vines burrow into its flesh and suck the blood out of them. Remains of previous victims litter the ground, but can be hard to spot beneath the greenery. There might even be an artifact here. Effect: A PC who Scouts the area successfully will notice the bones of previous victims. Anyone who walks into the greenery must make a Move roll or be incapacitated by the powerful spores. Lying on the ground, the victim suffers one point of damage per turn until he is broken or until someone pulls him out (a Force roll). The Nightmare Flowers can only be destroyed by fire. Count the flowers' combined Strength as 10. When it reaches zero, the flowers are dead and the area can be passed without risk.",
        ParasiteFungus: "Rarity: ±0. This deadly fungoid life form infects its victims through mycelium at close contact with an infected body. The Parasite Fungus grows inside the host's body and brain, with horrible pain as a result. The victim's behavior is also affected. Effect: After the time of infection, the victim suffers one point of damage per day. This damage can be healed by rest and grub, but this will mean the victim needs to eat more to keep from being broken. If broken, the victim suffers a critical injury from non-typical damage (page 92). At irregular intervals (whenever you want) the Parasite Fungus affects the victim's brain in order to make it come close to another host, to keep spreading the infection. The victim needs to make a Wits roll (no skill can be used) to resist the impulse. The only way to be cured is to be broken by damage and then Healed.",
        Razorback: "Rarity: ±0. A huge monster of a boar, standing taller than a mutant and angrier than a dozen. Despite its rather small legs, this beast can achieve an astonishing speed, and its rugged tusks can tear a car wreck apart. Anything seems to set the Razorback off on a killing frenzy, and stopping it is nigh impossible. The beast is not a predator and generally does not hunt to feed - instead in feeds on anything from corpses to Zone plants.",
        RotAnts: "Rarity: ±0. The Rot Ants are a legend among Zone travelers. The worst thing is not the insect as such - nasty as it is, the size of a fist and with powerful jaws - but the overwhelming numbers. Rot Ants don't build anthills. Instead, they barrage through the Zone in millions upon millions, devouring everything in their path. They are blind and consider any living thing as food. Stalkers claim to have seen a swarm of Zone Ants kill a Devourer in under a minute. As if that was not enough, these insect spread the Rot wherever they go. Effect: Any attack from Rot Ants, whether successful or not, inflicts one point for Rot on the victim. The Rot Ants' swarm is huge. It simply cannot be decimated by any weapons the PCs could conceivably get their hands on. The only way to survive is to run away.",
        Rotfish: "Rarity: ±0. In the murky waters of Zone lakes and rivers, the Rotfish lurk. This monster varies greatly in shape, from scaly flatfish to eel-like beasts with sharp fins. The Rotfish can attack swimmers or careless Zone travelers walking close to the waterline, and often pulls its prey down under water to drown it. Effect: In the turn after a successful Fight attack, the Rotfish can pull its prey down under water to drown it. The victim will suffer one point of damage per turn (unless Amphibian) and must make a Force roll to break free.",
        ScrapCrows: "Rarity: +1. Big, ash-feathered birds that live in flocks in the Zone. They can attack Zone travelers careless enough to walk out in the open, hacking at the eyes with their sharp beaks. These Rot-ridden birds are called Scrap Crows by the People because they are attracted by anything shiny especially valuable scrap from the Old Age. Swarm: Can only be harmed by fire or explosions.",
        TrashHawk: "Rarity: ±0. Perched on the roofs of tall ruins, the Trash Hawk watches the Zone for prey. Yellow and brown feathers make it blend in well in the wasteland. This predatory bird has claws long and sharp as knives, and attack by quickly swooping down at its target and simply ripping off a large piece of flesh. If big enough, it even grabs its prey and flies off with it. Stalkers claim to have seen Trash Hawks with a wingspan of 25 feet. Swooping Attack: A Trash Hawk can swoop down from Long distance and Fight its target immediately. The bird takes one point of damage itself in the attack. Lift Off: In the turn after a successful attack, the Trash Hawk can fly off with its prey if it makes a Force roll.",
        WormSwarm: "Rarity: -1. This enormous cluster of black worms, each a few inches long, has developed a collective mind and behaves like an individual being. A typical Worm Swarm consists of millions of maggots. These bizarre beings often dwell in dark and damp places, attacking prey that happen to pass by. The swarm moves rapidly to engulf the victim and cause it to panic, and then proceeds to eat it alive. Swarm: The Worm Swarm counts as a swarm and can only be damaged by fire and explosions.",
        ZoneDogs: "Rarity: +1. Packs of ever hungry mutated mutts are common in the Zone. They are scrawny, wiry and often lack fur.",
        ZoneRats: "Rarity: +1. These scrawny but unnervingly large rats live in hordes in the Zone. The Rot just seems to make them bigger and meaner. They are long as a mutant's arm and will chew into any meat they come across, alive or dead, with their long, yellow teeth. Swarm: Can only be damaged by fire or explosions. Rot: Every attack from a Zone Rat, whether successful or not, inflicts a Rot Point on the target.",
        ZoneSpider: "Rarity: ±0. In dark tunnels and ruins, mutated spiders grown to absurd sizes dwell. Careless Zone travelers who step right through old decayed tunnel roofs or who explore ancient ruins can end up right in the middle of a nest. The Zone Spiders feed on anything from corpses and refuse to living prey that they first paralyze with their poisonous bite. Posion: If the spider's bite inflicts damage, the poison enters the victim's body and causes one point of fatigue per turn until the victim is broken. A successful Heal roll (modification -2 if attempting it on oneself) to suck the poison out will stop the process.",
        ZoneWasps: "Rarity: ±0. The first thing the victims hear is the buzzing sound, unnaturally deep and repulsive. The Zone Wasps are black and yellow like their ancestors in the Old Age, but big as fists and just as hard. Their sting injects a potent hallucinogenic poison that confuses the prey and makes it easier for the insects to tear it apart. As if that was not bad enough, in combat the Zone Wasps emit pheromones that alert other Zone Wasps nearby, quickly swelling their numbers. Hallucinogenic Poison: All attacks that give the victim one or more points of damage also inflicts one point of confusion. Pheromones: The Strength of the swarm increases one step every turn until the victims are either dead or have escaped. Swarm: The Zone Wasps can only be damaged by fire or explosions.",
        ZoneLeeches: "Rarity: ±0. Fist-sized critters that dwell in thick undergrowth or in dark ruins, sensing the heat of passing prey and falling onto it. These slimy beasts have neither legs nor eyes, only a maw ringed by small and sharp teeth. If a leech lands on a living being, it immediately bites into the flesh and starts sucking blood out at an alarming rate. A dozen leeches can completely drain a grown mutant. Swarm: Zone Leeches can only be hurt by fire or explosions."

    threat_phenomenon: {
        AcidRain: "Rarity: +1. Heavy raindrops start to fall from the Zone sky. But this is no ordinary rain. The strongly acidic drops burn whatever they land on, and the PCs need to seek cover. When the Acid Rain is over (after D6 hours), everything in the area is pockmarked by the acid drops, and puddles of burning acid cover the ground. Effect: Anyone caught in the Acid Rain suffers an attack with a number of Base Dice determined by the intensity of the rain - 6 is normal, but anything from 4 to 10 is possible. Every / rolled inflicts one point of damage. Armor works normally. The victims suffer one attack like this per turn until they manage to find a shelter that protects them from the rain - this normally requires a Move roll.",
        AshStorm: "Rarity: +1. A strong gale sweeps across the Zone, whipping up the ashes that lie in droves among the ruins. The ash cloud reduces visibility to a few feet, stings the eyes and makes it hard to breathe. After a few hours, when the air finally clears, everything is covered in a fine layer of ash. Effect: Zone travelers who want to push on in the Ash Storm need to make an Endure roll. A failed roll means the travelers must stop and find shelter. The storm lasts D6 hours.",
        DustTornado: "Rarity: -1. The wind suddenly picks up and the air is filled by sand and ashes. Around the PCs, black twirling funnels of tornados appear. Suddenly, and old house is pulled apart by a black twister, moving right toward the PCs. Effect: Anyone in the path of the Dust Tornado needs to make a Move roll to get away in time. Failure results in an attack with 12 Base Dice (weapon damage 1). Cover and armor have their normal effect.",
        GhostLights: "Rarity: ±0. A pale green shimmering light moves among the ruins or trees in the area. If anyone tries to get close to the light, it moves away, as if aware if their presence. The strange light remains in the area for some minutes, then suddenly disappears. Effect: None - but feel free to let the players think otherwise. The PCs cannot affect the Ghost Lights in any way.",
        ElectricStorm: "Rarity: ±0. Dark clouds descend on the area. The air smells like metal, hairs stand straight up and all metal objects start to spark. Suddenly, lightning starts to strike everywhere. Again and again, the area is bombarded. The flashes of light are blinding and the thunder deafening. The Electric Storm only lasts a few minutes, but they feel like a lifetime. Effect: Anyone caught in the storm are subject to and attack with four Base Dice (weapon damage 1). A victim located on high ground or on something made of metal suffers an attack with eight Base Dice. Cover helps, but armor does not. Roll again in every turn until the PCs have found cover - which requires a successful Move roll.",
        HeatWave: "Rarity: ±0. The temperature suddenly peaks to an extreme level. The PCs find themselves panting and sweating profusely. Metal objects are painful to touch. Effect: Anyone caught in the heat must make an Endure roll after performing any physical action. This roll doesn't count as an action in itself - roll it immediately. Failure means suffering one point of fatigue. In addition, everyone suffering the Heat Wave must drink one ration of water every hour, or become Dehydrated (page 92). The Heat Wave lasts D6 hours. Comment: Use this phenomenon only in summer. In the wintertime, use Temperature Drop instead.",
        InertiaField: "Rarity: -1. Some distance away, the PCs spot a monster or a humanoid who seems completely frozen in the middle of a motion. If anyone moves closer, others see how this person seems to move in slow motion. In this area, there is a strange force field that makes time itself slow down. To anyone moving into the field, the outside world seems to move more quickly. The effect increases further into the field. It is possible to talk to someone inside of the field, but to him the voices will speak very quickly and be very shrill. His own voice will be slow to persons outside of the field. Effect: Being at the outer rim of the field is not dangerous, but anyone moving toward its center risks being caught in it forever. Let a PC who moves into the field (or who seems someone else caught in it) roll to Know the Zone. If successful, the PC realizes the risk.",
        MagneticField: "Rarity: -1. The remains of some sort of ancient underground power plant creates a strong magnetic field in this area. The PCs hear a low humming sound and get goosebumps on their skin. If they linger in the area, they will feel metal objects being pulled toward a particular point. Effect: The PCs must either drop all metal objects that they are carrying, or make a Force roll to get out of the Magnetic Field with their metal gear. Anyone wearing scrap armor must make a Force roll, it's not possible to get out of the armor fast enough. Anyone who fails the roll can try again in the next turn, but with a −1 modification. The modification grows to −2 in the third turn, etc. Suddenly and inexplicably (whenever you decide), the Magnetic Field dissipates.",
        Mirage: "Rarity: -1. The terrain close to the PCs suddenly blurs and deforms. It changes appearance completely and now looks like it did in the Old Age - no decay, no debris, everything clean and orderly. The PCs have walked into a hologram, the remains of ancient defensive perimeter. Effect: The PCs risk bumping into things that they cannot see, and therefore must act as if in total darkness (page 93). The hologram is approximately 50 feet across.",
        MudPuddles: "Rarity: ±0. This foggy area is covered by large puddles of thick, warm mud. There is solid ground underneath the mud, but it will reach to the knees of anyone who walks through the puddles. In addition, there are hidden wells of steaming hot water in some places. Walking through the area risks triggering geysers of hot water, scalding everyone nearby. Effect: A PC who successfully Scouts the area will notice bubbles and steam coming out of the mud at certain locations. Wading through the area requires a Know the Zone roll - failure means triggering a steam geyser. Roll six Base Dice to attack everyone within Near distance. Every / rolled inflicts one point of damage. Armor has the normal effect. Anyone who suffers one or more points of damage also gets one Rot Point. Staying in this area has one useful effect - the hot steam keeps the area warm, and thus protects against severe cold.",
        NightLights: "Rarity: -1. Huge, billowing lights in sickly colors fill the night sky. Artifacts and other gear that run on electricity start to work erratically, or not at all. Some see a bad omen in these lights, others the sign of a new dawn for the world. Some just find the lights pretty. The lights last until morning. Effect: All electric artifacts (such as the Flashlight, Cassette Player, and Video Camera) won't work properly as long as the Night Lights linger. Comment: If you roll up this phenomenon in the daytime, have the Night Lights appear the following evening.",
        Obelisk: "Rarity: -1. In the middle of wasteland, the tall black Obelisk stands. It seems to be made of some kind of very durable metal. The PCs cannot find any visible hatches or slits in the metal, and the Obelisk seems to be completely untouched by the passage of time. The Obelisk seems alien to the PCs, and it can even affect their minds in strange ways. Effect: The energies emanating from The Obelisk can induce psychedelic hallucinations. Anyone within Short range of it must make a Know the Zone roll - failure means suffering a point of confusion.",
        PillarsOfLight: "Rarity: ±0. Two big pillars of light appear by the horizon, beaming up toward the black Zone sky. Where do the lights originate? And why have they appeared now? Effect: None. But have NPCs tell tales of these lights, saying that the lead the way to Eden, to another Ark, or that they are a bad omen.",
        RotHotspot: "Rarity: ±0. The coast seems clear. There are no visible threats around, and the exploration can commence unhindered. But in this place, the Rot is very strong and can kill unwitting Zone travelers or scar them for life. Effect: Give the players a chance to notice that something is amiss, such as a number of cadavers on the ground or a pipe leaking green sludge. Anyone who proceeds despite the warning signs suffers one Rot Point per minute in the area.",
        RotWind: "Rarity: ±0. A wind carrying foul Rot-ridden fumes sweep across the sector. The air is filled by dust and a sickening stench. Effect: The Rot Wind immediately inflicts one Rot Points on every person caught in it. In addition, any water or grub carried by the PCs will be contaminated by Rot, inflicting one Rot Point per ration consumed. The Rot Wind lasts D6 hours.",
        Sinkhole: "Rarity: ±0. The ground suddenly gives in, and a huge hole into the ground or into some ancient underground facility opens up. Effect: Anyone close to the collapse must make a Move roll to avoid falling into the Sinkhole. Doing so inflicts one point of damage in itself - and can expose the victim to any number of underground threats, such as monsters or Rot. Climbing up can also be difficult, usually requiring a Move roll.",
        TemperatureDrop: "Rarity ±0. Suddenly, the wind picks up, the temperature drops and a heavy snowfall starts. Then, the wind and the snowing stops. A wall of white clouds forms a tall cylinder right above the PCs. A crystal blue sky can be seen above. The serenity comes with a cost - the temperature drops dramatically. Exposure can be lethal. Effect: Any Zone travelers caught out in the open must immediately roll to Endure severe cold (page 93). One roll every 15 minutes is required, until the cold spot passes (after D6 hours) or the PCs move out of the sector. Lighting a fire can keep the cold at bay, but it requires firewood and an Agility roll (no skill used). Comment: Use this phenomenon only in winter. In the summertime, use Heat Wave instead.",
        UnexplodedOrdnance: "Rarity: ±1. This entire area is scarred by gunshots and explosions. In the ground, mines and/or unexploded grenades and bombs are hidden. Walking through this area is very dangerous. Effect: Anyone who walks through the area must make a Move roll. Failure means triggering a Blast Power 6 explosion at Arm's Length.",
        Vacuum: "Rarity: -1. The PCs pass an area completely void of air. There is no visible explanation as to why the air does not fill this void. The first thing the PCs notice is that they cannot speak or breathe. Effect: Anyone caught in the Vacuum must make a Move roll. Failure means that the victims panics and remains in the Vacuum another turn. Every turn in the Vacuum inflicts one point of damage. One roll to get out of the Vacuum is allowed per turn.",
        ZoneSmog: "Rarity: +1. A thick, yellowish fog rises from the ground. At first, is stays at knee-height, but soon it completely obscures vision. Eyes tear up and the smog burns the nose and mouth when breathing. Effect: Everyone caught in the Zone Smog suffers one Rot Point. Vision is limited to Near range - the PCs cannot see (or Shoot at) anything farther away. Some Zone monsters take advantage of the Zone Smog to hunt - feel free to choose or roll one up. The only way to escape the smog is to find an elevated position like a tall building or a hill. The Zone Smog stays at ground level, and dissipates after D6 hours."
